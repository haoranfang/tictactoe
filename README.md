# React-Tac-Toe

This module is a Tic-Tac-Toe game played in the browser, completed as part of a [course](http://arch-joelross.rhcloud.com/) at the UW ISchool. 

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission!


##### 1. Does using a Model-View-Controller architecture make it easier to change your game in the future? How many places would you need to make changes to your code to make this a 5x5 game of Tic-Tac-Toe?
> I think it should be easier to change my game in the future. I did not write the code in a efficient way (but I tried my best) so there will be a lot of places to change to make it a 5*5game. For example, change the maximium times to indicate the end of game, change the length of array, add more brid, add more brid's corresponding class/functions.


##### 2. Why did I say that an `Array` is the best data structure to represent the game's grid of cells? Why not a 2D-array (Array of Arrays), or an Object, or a Linked-List, or a Tree? 
> I am not really sure about this. I think that is because array is clearer while it can complete the work without getting too complicated.


##### 3. What online resources did you find to help you learn React? How do you search for resources, and how did you determine whether they were helpful or not? Think back to the "learning an API" paper! 
> I google a lot to help me learn React. I basically find information and direction from their official website as well as lecture slides. I think they are helpful when they have examples.


##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I spent more than 4 whole days on this assignment.


##### 5. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Not really.


##### 6. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
>I am not sure what to put into controller for some reason. I added some functions inside view since I think it will be easier to update information when it is deciding what to show users. However, in that case, my controller does not have things to do so I was really confused about that. I wish we can have more hints about what goes under controller.
